          I was hired in 2021 as a Senior Product Designer to focus on their web
          and e-commerce experiences. At Matterport, I worked with
          cross-functional teams to plan, design, and launch improved user

          E-commerce Navigation Project
        </h3>
        <p>
          In order to add additional revenue opportunities through Matterport's
          e-commerce experience, the company wanted to start selling accessories
          for specific products. To support this objective, I designed a new
          navigation pattern that elevated product categories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding a new product category to the e-commerce experience meant
          re-evaluating how that product categories appeared to users.
          Historically, Matterport sold accessories as part of bundled hardware
          kits, so this shift in product merchandising required analysis of the
          types of accessories for sale, relationship of those accessories to
          other product categories, and the simplest path to both educate and
          inform the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          I designed a few different iterations based on my understanding of the
          accessory products, and leaned on some user experience research
          findings to understand how best to position this to customers. Those
          findings also suggested that having clear visibility and understanding
          into the product being sold could make the difference between someone
          completing a purchase vs. closing the tab and moving on. In response,
          my designs focused on clear hierarchy, simple language use, and
          creating connective tissue between product categories.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final designs resulted in creating an information architecture
          pattern that included the all product categories, and applying
          Matterport's design system tokens across typography, color, and
          spacing elements.
