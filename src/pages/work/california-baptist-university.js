          (CBU) is one of Southern California's fastest growing private
          universities. As of Fall 2020, CBU boasts a total enrollment over
          11,000 and offers a diverse mix of degrees and credential programs
          primarily serving students who reside in the Inland Empire communities
          of Riverside and San Bernardino.

          I was hired in 2012 as a Website Manager to function as both an
          individual contributor designing and developing new pages on the main
          university website and a manager tasked with building a web team. In
          2015, I was promoted to Senior Web Services Manager where my role as
          an individual contributor slowly shifted toward a person, process, and
          project manager with larger, more strategic work as an area manager,
          helping steward the work of my employees. In 2018, I transferred
          departments from Marketing to Information Technology as Director of
          Web Applications Development for a greater challenge where I led a
          team focused on designing and developing enterprise web applications
          used daily by thousands of users.
