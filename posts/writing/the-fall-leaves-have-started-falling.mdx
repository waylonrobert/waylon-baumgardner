We are now well into the autumnal time of year, replete with changing seasons, less daylight, and antipcation of the closing quarter of the calendar year.

It was an incredibly busy summer for me: 

* I started a new job a little over a month ago at [Matterport](https://matterport.com "Matterport"), working on their platform design team in a senior product design role focused on web marketing and e-commerce
* I'm still making progress on my weight loss journey
* I began mentoring junior designers via the [ADPList](https://adplist.org "ADPList") platform (in addition to various mentoring I've been doing via LinkedIn for awhile)
* I continued my volunteer service as a director on the [HighEdWeb](https://highedweb.org "Higher Education Web Professionals") board of directors
* I bought a new car (and a way more practical car than I imagined I would get as my next car after turning in my previous car lease at the start of summer)
* I'm deep in the planning stages of my first novel, ever so slowly chipping away at <Link to={`/writing/side-projects`} title="Side projects" />

And there's still a lot more ahead to wrap up this year, but I'm growing evermore optimistic that 2022 will be a _great_ year. I'll post another update soon. Until then, be well!
