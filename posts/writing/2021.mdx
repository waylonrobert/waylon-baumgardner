For the first time in awhile, I woke up feeling a bit happier about the state of my country in general. I did not realize how much an inept government was keeping me in this bizarre stupor.

As the day wore on, and as I witnessed work actually happening at the federal level, I found myself hopeful.

In the spirit of maintaining that energy, I wrote this post to highlight what I'm looking forward to this year:

* Working towards my ongoing health journey (<Link to={`/writing/20-pounds-down`} title="20 pounds down">latest update</Link>)
* Making progress on one or more <Link to={`/writing/side-projects`} title="Side Projects">side projects</Link>
* Some changes in my day job that, while exciting, will also challenge me (a good thing)
* A renewed focus and energy on writing, a passion of mine I've forsaken for far too long
* Continued investment into my marriage (celebrating 12 years in October)
* Hopefully bearing witness to stemming the COVID-19 tide

Hoping you can find some things to look forward to as well. Take care, wear a mask, and look out for each other.
