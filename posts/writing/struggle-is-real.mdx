Another progress update on my personal health and weight loss journey. I'm in what I believe is a bit of plateau; I've experienced some gains and losses over the past couple of weeks that has all but stopped my overall weight loss progress. 

I've been thinking about it today, notably how _difficult_ losing weight is, and how it requires 100% of your _attention_ and _dedication_. I completely understand now why healthly living is often referred to as a "lifestyle" (not that I didn't understand it before, but I have a different perspective now).

Just a small note to myself that you're doing GREAT and to keep up the good work! If anyone finds this and is finding themselves thinking along similar lines, know you're not alone and you CAN do it!
